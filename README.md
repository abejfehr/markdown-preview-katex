# Markdown Preview with Math

![Markdown Preview with Math](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abejfehr/markdown-preview-katex/master/imgs/preview.png)

Just a fork of [Markdown Preview Plus](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview-plus) that renders math with KaTeX instead of MathJax so it's not a pain to install. Shows the rendered HTML markdown to the right of the
current editor using the keymap `ctrl-shift-m`.

## Dependency-free LaTeX equation rendering
  LaTeX equations in the source markdown are rendered in the preview pane using [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX).
  Rendering of LaTeX equations in the preview pane can be toggled with
  `ctrl-shift-x`. Please see [LaTeX](LATEX.md) for more details.
